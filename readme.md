for running the api, you need to have credentials.json on the utils/files folder, We have removed that for security reasons,
We have attached the demo recording and demo screenshot, as demo-record.mov and demo-screenshot.png

# Steps to install

1. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run the meetingCreator.js in utils folder with credentials.json in utils/files folder
3. Run the server

```
npm start
```

4. Run the index.html file with liveserver.

That's it, 👍🏻
